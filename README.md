This repository contains an [implementation](src/kraus_tables.sage) of Kraus's algorithm [[1]](#1) for computing monodromy for elliptic curves over Q_p, where p=2,3. Sage worksheets (Jupyter notebooks) comparing Kodaira types, monodromy groups, and conductors for all curves in the Cremona database of various interesting classes are given. I have also included various (messy) worksheets I used to conduct my own investigation, in the off chance that they could be of use to someone else.
